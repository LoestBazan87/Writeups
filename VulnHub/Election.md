```bash
arp-scan -I ens33 --localnet --ignoredups
```
```
arp-scan
This is a command-line tool used to scan a network for active devices using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). It is useful for discovering devices on a local network.

-I ens33
The -I flag specifies the network interface to use for scanning. In this case, ens33 is the network interface (which may vary depending on your system; you can check available interfaces with ip link show or ifconfig).

--localnet
This tells arp-scan to scan the entire local network based on the subnet assigned to ens33. It automatically calculates the IP range from the interfaceâ€™s configuration.

--ignoredups
This option ensures that duplicate ARP responses from the same device are ignored, which can be useful in noisy networks where duplicate replies might be common.

```bash
ping -c 1 192.168.1.208
```
```bash
ping
The ping command is used to check network connectivity between your machine and another device by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets.
-c 1
The -c flag specifies the number of echo request packets to send. In this case, -c 1 means only one packet will be sent.
